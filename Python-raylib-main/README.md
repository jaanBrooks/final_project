## 🛠 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** installed on your system
- **raylib Python binding** — Install via pip:

```bash
pip install raylib
```

> **Note:** If you use a different binding or version (e.g., `raylib-python-cffi`), adjust the import statements accordingly.

### Running a Demo

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NguyenLe15325/Python-raylib.git
   cd Python-raylib
   ```

2. **Run one of the demos:**
   ```bash
   python 3.Pong.py
   ```

3. **Explore, modify, and experiment!**
   - Change colors, speeds, or physics parameters
   - Add new features or mechanics
   - Build your own game using these as templates

#### 🎯 What Makes It Special

This demo showcases a complete 3D physics simulation environment where you can interact with multiple spherical objects in real-time. It's not just a demonstration—it's a fully playable physics sandbox that responds to your every action!

#### ✨ Key Features

- **🕹️ Free Camera Movement** — Navigate through 3D space with WASD controls and mouse look
- **🤲 Object Interaction** — Hold and throw spheres with realistic physics
- **⚡ Real-time Physics** — Watch objects bounce, collide, and interact with gravity
- **🎨 Multiple Objects** — Experiment with spheres of different sizes, masses, and colors
- **🔧 Highly Configurable** — Tweak physics parameters to create your own simulation

#### 🎮 Controls

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `W` `A` `S` `D` | Move camera forward/left/back/right |
| `Space` / `Left Shift` | Move camera up/down |
| `Mouse` | Look around (first-person view) |
| `Left Click` | Grab/hold sphere |
| `Mouse Scroll` | Adjust grabbed object's distance from camera |
| `Release Click` | Throw sphere (velocity based on mouse movement) |
| `ESC` | Exit simulation |

#### ⚙️ Configurable Parameters

The simulation is designed to be tweaked! Here are some parameters you can adjust:

```python
# Screen Settings
SCREEN_WIDTH = 1200
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 800
FPS = 60

# Physics Constants
GRAVITY_ACCEL = Vector3(0.0, -9.81, 0.0)  # Earth-like gravity
BOUNDS_SIZE = 15.0                         # Simulation cube size
FRICTION_FACTOR = 0.85                     # Bounce elasticity (0-1)
THROW_FACTOR = 0.5                         # Throw strength multiplier

# Camera Settings
CAM_SPEED = 15.0                          # Movement speed
CAM_SENSITIVITY = 0.15                    # Mouse sensitivity
CAMERA_BOUNDS_SIZE = 18.0                 # Camera movement limits
```

#### 🎨 Customize Your Spheres

Create your own physics objects with different properties:

```python
spheres = [
    # Small and light - bounces easily
    Sphere(Vector3(-5.0, 5.0, 0.0), radius=0.7, mass=0.5, color=SKYBLUE),
    
    # Medium size - balanced behavior
    Sphere(Vector3(5.0, 10.0, 0.0), radius=1.5, mass=3.0, color=LIME),
    
    # Tiny and floaty - fun to throw
    Sphere(Vector3(0.0, 15.0, 5.0), radius=0.5, mass=0.2, color=YELLOW),
    
    # Large and heavy - powerful collisions
    Sphere(Vector3(-10.0, 10.0, -5.0), radius=2.0, mass=5.0, color=MAGENTA)
]
```

#### 🔬 What You'll Learn

- **3D Camera Systems** — First-person camera with constraints and smooth movement
- **Vector Physics** — Velocity, acceleration, and force calculations in 3D
- **Collision Detection** — Sphere-to-sphere and sphere-to-boundary collisions
- **Realistic Interactions** — Momentum transfer, friction, and energy conservation
- **Input Handling** — Mouse picking and drag-to-throw mechanics
- **Performance Optimization** — Efficient physics updates at 60 FPS

#### 💡 Experiment Ideas

Try these modifications to learn more:

1. **Adjust gravity** — What happens in low gravity? Or with reversed gravity?
2. **Change elasticity** — Make everything super bouncy or completely inelastic
3. **Add more spheres** — How many objects can the simulation handle?
4. **Modify masses** — Create very heavy or very light objects and observe interactions
5. **Change bounds** — Make the simulation space larger or smaller
6. **Add spin** — Implement rotational physics for even more realism
